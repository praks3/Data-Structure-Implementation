# Object-Oriented Data Structures and Functionalities

This repository contains implementations of various data structures with the listed functionalities, all developed using object-oriented principles.

## Linked List

### Functionality List

- **Insert**: Add an element to the end of the linked list.
- **Insert at position**: Insert an element at a specified position in the linked list.
- **Delete**: Remove a specified element from the linked list.
- **Delete at position**: Remove an element from a specific position in the linked list.
- **Center**: Find the center element of the linked list.
- **Sort**: Sort the linked list in ascending order.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the order of elements in the linked list.
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the linked list.
- **Iterator**: Provide an iterator for traversing the linked list.
- **Traverse/Print**: Print the elements of the linked list.

## Stack

### Functionality List

- **Push**: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- **Pop**: Remove and return the top element from the stack.
- **Peek**: Get the top element without removing it.
- **Contains**: Check if a specific element is present in the stack.
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the stack.
- **Center**: Find the center element of the stack.
- **Sort**: Sort the elements in the stack.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the order of elements in the stack.
- **Iterator**: Provide an iterator for traversing the stack.
- **Traverse/Print**: Print the elements of the stack.

## Queue

### Functionality List

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the back of the queue.
- **Dequeue**: Remove and return the front element from the queue.
- **Peek**: Get the front element without removing it.
- **Contains**: Check if a specific element is present in the queue.
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the queue.
- **Center**: Find the center element of the queue.
- **Sort**: Sort the elements in the queue.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the order of elements in the queue.
- **Iterator**: Provide an iterator for traversing the queue.
- **Traverse/Print**: Print the elements of the queue.

## Priority Queue

### Functionality List

- **Enqueue**: Add an element to the priority queue.
- **Dequeue (Highest Priority)**: Remove and return the highest priority element from the queue.
- **Peek (Highest Priority)**: Get the highest priority element without removing it.
- **Contains**: Check if a specific element is present in the priority queue.
- **Size**: Get the number of elements in the priority queue.
- **Reverse**: Reverse the order of elements in the priority queue.
- **Center**: Find the center element of the priority queue.
- **Iterator**: Provide an iterator for traversing the priority queue.
- **Traverse/Print**: Print the elements of the priority queue.

## Hash Table

### Functionality List

- **Insert**: Add a key-value pair to the hash table.
- **Delete**: Remove a key-value pair from the hash table.
- **Contains**: Check if a specific key is present in the hash table.
- **Get Value by Key**: Retrieve the value associated with a specific key.
- **Size**: Get the number of key-value pairs in the hash table.
- **Iterator**: Provide an iterator for traversing the hash table.
- **Traverse/Print**: Print the key-value pairs of the hash table.

## Usage

1. Each data structure has been implemented as a separate class.
2. You can import the relevant class into your project and create instances of the data structure.
3. Utilize the provided methods to perform the specified functionalities on the data structure.
